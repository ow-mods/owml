# Outer Wilds Mod Loader

OWML is the mod loader and mod framework for Outer Wilds. It patches Outer Wilds to load mods, and provides mods a framework to interact with the game. OWML is inspired by SMAPI for Stardew Valley.

## How it works

OWML does the following:
1. Patches the game to make it call the mod loader.
2. Starts the game.
3. The mod loader loads and initializes installed mods.

## Installation

With Outer Wilds Mod Manager (recommended):
1. Download the Mod Manager from the [Outer Wilds Mods](https://outerwildsmods.com/) website.
2. Use the Mod Manager to install OWML and mods, and start the game.

Manual install:
1. Download latest OWML release and extract the zip file anywhere you want.
2. [Download Outer Wilds mods](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods) and put them in the `mods` folder, each mod in a separate folder.
3. Start the game with OWML.Launcher.exe.

## Uninstall
- If using Outer Wilds Mod Manager, first refer to it's uninstall guide.
- If not, delete OWML folder.
- Verify integrity of game files - OWML edits the game code to load itself, so verification is needed to remove the changes.
  - Steam : Right click on game > Properties > Local files > Verify integrity of game files
  - Epic : Three dots next to game > Verify

If you want to keep mod data intact but still play without mods, verifying the game files is enough. Just make sure to run the game through Steam/Epic, *not* OWML.Launcher.exe.

## For modders

Refer to the sample mods in the source code for examples. These mods are not included in releases.

### Get started

1. Create a C# class library project targeting .Net Framework 4.0.
2. Install the [OWML Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OWML/).
3. Reference the following files in {gamePath}\OuterWilds_Data\Managed:
    * Assembly-CSharp.dll
    * UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll
    * More Unity DLLs if needed
4. Inherit from ModBehaviour.
